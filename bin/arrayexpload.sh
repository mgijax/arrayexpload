###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:
#
#      This script is a wrapper around the process that loads ArrayExpress
#      associations from an input file.
#
#  Usage:
#
#      arrayexpload.sh
#
#  Env Vars:
#
#      See the configuration file
#
#      - Configuration file (arrayexpload.config)
#
#  Inputs:
#
#      - An input file (${INPUT_FILE}) that contains MGI IDs that need to
#        be associated with the markers using the ArrayExpresss logical DB.
#
#  Outputs:
#
#      - Log file (${ARRAYEXP_LOGFILE})
#
#      - Association file (${INFILE_NAME})
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0:  Successful completion
#      1:  Fatal error occurred
#
#  Assumes:  Nothing
#
#  Implementation:
#
#      This script will perform following steps:
#
#      1) Source the configuration file to establish the environment.
#      2) Verify that the input files exist.
#      3) Determine if the input file has changed since the last time that
#         the load was run. Do not continue if the input file is not new.
#      4) Create the association file from the input file.
#      5) Call the association loader.
#      6) Touch the "lastrun" file to timestamp when the load was run.
#
#  Notes:  None
